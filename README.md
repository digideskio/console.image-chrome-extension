# Chrome console.image extension
### console.image on any page on the internet

A very simple Chrome extension to take @dunxrion's glorious [console.image](https://github.com/dunxrion/console.image) and inject it into every single page

#Thanks

Thanks to @dunxrion for the original script (he didn't include a specific license, so contact me if this is a problem and I'll take it down)

Kudos to [egeozcan](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5962384) on Hacker News for the inspiration.
